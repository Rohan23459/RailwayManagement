# Railway Management System
## Objective
Railway is a very important part of India's transportation system. Proper management of it is equally important. There are so many trains and so many passengers as well, along with different ticket fares based on compartments. Different trains have different timings and different routes as well. If they are not managed properly, there would be absolute chaos. The main objective of this project is to provide solution to this problem by providing a system which would reduce the manual work and help in the management. This project is totally built at administrative level and thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access. This project is focused on a single railway station.
